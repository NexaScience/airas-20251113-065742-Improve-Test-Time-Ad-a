Numerous studies have been conducted to narrow the performance gap based on a variety of hypotheses/settings. Unsupervised domain adaptation meth- ods (Ganin et al., 2016) necessitate simultaneous access to labeled training data and unlabeled target data, limiting their applications. Source-free domain adaptation approaches (Liang et al., 2020) only need a trained model and do not require original training data when performing adaptation. Nonethe- less, in a more difﬁcult and realistic setting, known as fully test-time adaptation (Wang et al., 2021), the model must perform online adaptation to the test stream in real-time inference. The model is adapted in a single pass on the test stream using a pre-trained model and continuously arriving test data (rather than a prepared target set). Ofﬂine iterative training or extra heavy computational burdens beyond normal inference do not meet the requirements. There have been several studies aimed at fully test-time adaptation. Test-time BN (Nado et al., 2020) / BN adapt (Schneider et al., 2020) directly uses the normalization statistics derived from test samples instead of those inherited from the training data, which is found to be beneﬁcial in reducing the performance gap. Entropy-minimization-based methods, such as TENT (Wang et al., 2021), further optimize model parameters during inference. Contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2022), data augmentation (Wang et al., 2022a) and uncertainty-aware optimization (Niu et al., 2022) have been introduced to enhance adaptation performance. Efforts have also been made to address test-time adaptation in more complex test environments, like LAME (Boudiaf et al., 2022). ∗work done by Bowen Zhao (during internship) and Chen Chen at Tencent. 1 arXiv:2301.13018v1  [cs.LG]  30 Jan 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 −→IS+CB DS+CB IS+CI DS+CI Figure 1: IS+CB / DS+CB: the test stream which is inde- pendently / dependently sampled from a class-balanced test distribution; IS+CI/ DS+CI: independently / dependently drawn from a class-imbalanced test distribution.

DELTA achieves improvement in all scenarios. Scenario TENT LAME DELTA (Ours) IS+CBDS+CBIS+CIDS+CI Despite the achieved progress, we ﬁnd that there are non-negligible defects hidden in the popular methods. First, we take a closer look at the normalization statistics within inference (Section 3.2). We observe that the statistics used in BN adapt is inaccurate in per batch compared to the actual pop- ulation statistics. Second, we reveal that the prevalent test-time model updating is biased towards some dominant categories (Section 3.3). We notice that the model predictions are extremely imbal- anced on out-of-distribution data, which can be exacerbated by the self-learning-based adaptation methods. Besides the most common independent and class-balanced test samples considered in ex- isting studies, following Boudiaf et al. (2022), we investigate other three test scenarios as illustrated in Figure 1 (please see details in Section 3.1) and ﬁnd when facing the more intricate test streams, like dependent samples or class-imbalanced data, the prevalent methods would suffer from severe performance degradation, which limits the usefulness of these test-time adaptation strategies. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose two powerful tools. Speciﬁcally, to handle the in- accurate normalization statistics, we introduce test-time batch renormalization (TBR) (Section 3.2), which uses the test-time moving averaged statistics to rectify the normalized features and considers normalization during gradient optimization. By taking advantage of the observed test samples, the calibrated normalization is more accurate. We further propose dynamic online re-weighting (DOT) (Section 3.3) to tackle the biased optimization, which is derived from cost-sensitive learning. To bal- ance adaptation, DOT assigns low/high weights to the frequent/infrequent categories. The weight mapping function is based on a momentum-updated class-frequency vector that takes into account multiple sources of category bias, including the pre-trained model, the test stream, and the adap- tation methods (the methods usually do not have an intrinsic bias towards certain classes, but can accentuate existing bias). TBR can be applied directly to the common BN-based pre-trained mod- els and does not interfere with the training process (corresponding to the fully test-time adaptation setting), and DOT can be easily combined with other adaptation approaches as well. Table 1 compares our method to others on CIFAR100-C across various scenarios. The existing test-time adaptation methods behave differently across the four scenarios and show performance degradation in some scenarios. While our tools perform well in all four scenarios simultaneously without any prior knowledge of the test data, which is important for real-world applications. Thus, the whole method is named DELTA (Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation). The major contributions of our work are as follows. (i) We expose the defects in commonly used test-time adaptation methods, which ultimately harm adaptation performance. (ii) We demonstrate that the defects will be even more severe in complex test environments, causing performance degra- dation. (iii) To achieve degradation-free fully test-time adaptation, we propose DELTA which com- prises two components: TBR and DOT, to improve the normalization statistics estimates and mit- igate the bias within optimization. (iv) We evaluate DELTA on three common datasets with four scenarios and a newly introduced real-world dataset, and ﬁnd that it can consistently improve the popular test-time adaptation methods on all scenarios, yielding new state-of-the-art results. 2 RELATED WORK Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).In reality, test distribution is frequently inconsistent with the training distribution, resulting in poor performance. UDA aims to alleviate the phenomenon with the collected unlabeled samples from the target distribution. One popular approach is to align the sta- tistical moments across different distributions (Gretton et al., 2006; Zellinger et al., 2017; Long et al., 2017). Another line of studies adopts adversarial training to achieve adaptation (Ganin et al., 2016; 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Long et al., 2018). UDA has been developed for many tasks including object classiﬁcation (Saito et al., 2017)/detection (Li et al., 2021) and semantic segmentation (Hoffman et al., 2018). Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA).SFDA deals with domain gap with only the trained model and the prepared unlabeled target data. To be more widely used, SFDA methods should be built on a common source model trained by a standard pipeline. SHOT (Liang et al., 2020) freezes the source model’s classiﬁer and optimizes the feature extractor via entropy minimization, diversity regularization, and pseudo-labeling. SHOT incorporates weight normalization, 1D BN, and label- smoothing into backbones and training, which do not exist in most off-the-shelf trained models, but its other ideas can be used. USFDA (Kundu et al., 2020) utilizes synthesized samples to achieve compact decision boundaries. NRC (Yang et al., 2021b) encourages label consistency among local target features with the same network architecture as SHOT. GSFDA (Yang et al., 2021a) further expects the adapted model performs well not only on target data but also on source data. Fully test-time adaptation (FTTA). FTTA is a more difﬁcult and realistic setting. In the same way that SFDA does not provide the source training data, only the trained model is provided. Unlike SFDA, FTTA cannot access the entire target dataset; however, the methods should be capable of do- ing online adaptation on the test stream and providing instant predictions for the arrived test samples. BN adapt (Nado et al., 2020; Schneider et al., 2020) replaces the normalization statistics estimated during training with those derived from the test mini-batch. On top of it, TENT (Wang et al., 2021) optimizes the afﬁne parameters in BN through entropy minimization during test. EATA (Niu et al., 2022) and CoTTA (Wang et al., 2022a) study long-term test-time adaptation in continually changing environments. ETA (Niu et al., 2022) excludes unreliable and redundant samples from the opti- mization. AdaContrast (Chen et al., 2022) resorts to contrastive learning to promote feature learning along with a pseudo label reﬁnement mechanism. Both AdaContrast and CoTTA utilize heavy data augmentation during test, which will increase inference latency. Besides, AdaContrast modiﬁes the model architecture as in SHOT. Different from them, LAME (Boudiaf et al., 2022) does not rectify the model’s parameters but only the model’s output probabilities via the introduced unsupervised objective laplacian adjusted maximum-likelihood estimation. Class-imbalanced learning. Training with class-imbalanced data has attracted widespread atten- tion (Liu et al., 2019). Cost-sensitive learning (Elkan, 2001) and resampling (Wang et al., 2020) are the classical strategies to handle this problem. Ren et al. (2018) designs a meta-learning paradigm to assign weights to samples. Class-balanced loss (Cui et al., 2019) uses the effective number of samples when performing re-weighting. Decoupled training (Kang et al., 2020b) learns the feature extractor and the classiﬁer separately. Menon et al. (2021) propose logit adjustment from a statis- tical perspective. Other techniques such as weight balancing (Alshammari et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2020), contrastive learning (Kang et al., 2020a), knowledge distillation (He et al., 2021), etc. have also been applied to solve this problem. 3 DELTA: DEGRADATION -FREE FULLY TEST -TIME ADAPTATION 3.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION Assume that we have the training dataDtrain = {(xi,yi)}Ntrain i=1 ∼Ptrain(x,y), where x∈X is the input and y ∈Y = {1,2,··· ,K}is the target label; f{θ0,a0}denotes the model with parameters θ0 and normalization statistics a0 learned or estimated on Dtrain. Without loss of generality, we denote the test stream asDtest = {(xj,yj)}Ntest j=1 ∼Ptest(x,y), where {yj}are not available actually, the subscript j also indicates the sample position within the test stream. When Ptest(x,y) ̸= Ptrain(x,y) (the input/output space X/Yis consistent between training and test data), f{θ0,a0}may perform poorly on Dtest. Under fully test-time adaptation scheme (Wang et al., 2021), during inference step t≥1, the model f{θt−1,at−1}receives a mini-batch of test data {xmt+b}B b=1 with B batch size (mt is the number of test samples observed before inference step t), and then elevates itself to f{θt,at}based on current test mini-batch and outputs the real-time predictions {pmt+b}B b=1 (p ∈RK). Finally, the evaluation metric is calculated based on the online predictions from each inference step. Fully test-time adaptation emphasizes performing adaptation during real-time inference entirely, i.e., the training process cannot be interrupted, the training data is no longer available during test, and the adaptation should be accomplished in a single pass over the test stream. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 The most common hypothesis is that Dtest is independently sampled from Ptest(x,y). However, in real environment, the assumption does not always hold, e.g., samples of some classes may appear more frequently in a certain period of time, leading to another hypothesis: the test samples are depen- dently sampled. Most studies only considered the scenario with class-balanced test samples, while in real-world, the test stream can be class-imbalanced 1. We investigate fully test-time adaptation under the four scenarios below, considering the latent sampling strategies and the test class distri- bution. For convenience, we denote the scenario where test samples are independently/dependently sampled from a class-balanced test distribution as IS+CB / DS+CB; denote the scenario where test samples are independently/dependently sampled from a class-imbalanced test distribution as IS+CI/ DS+CI, as shown in Figure 1. Among them, IS+CB is the most common scenario within FTTA studies, and the other three scenarios also frequently appear in real-world applications. 3.2 A CLOSER LOOK AT NORMALIZATION STATISTICS We revisit BN (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) brieﬂy. Let v ∈RB×C×S×S′ be a mini-batch of features with C channels, height S and width S′. BN normalizes v with the normalization statistics µ,σ ∈RC: v∗ = v−µ σ ,v⋆ = γ ·v∗ + β, where γ,β ∈ RC are the learnable afﬁne parameters, {γ,β}⊂ θ. We mainly focus on the ﬁrst part v → v∗ (all the discussed normalization meth- ods adopt the afﬁne parameters). In BN, during training, µ,σ are set to the empirical mean µbatch and standard deviation σbatch calculated for each channel c: µbatch[c] = 1 BSS′ ∑ b,s,s′v[b,c,s,s ′], σbatch[c] = √ 1 BSS′ ∑ b,s,s′(v[b,c,s,s ′] −µbatch[c])2 + ϵ, where ϵis a small value to avoid division by zero. During inference, µ,σ are set to µema, σema which are the exponential-moving-average (EMA) estimates over training process ( a0 is formed by the EMA statistics of all BN modules). However, when Ptest(x,y) ̸= Ptrain(x,y), studies found that replacing µema,σema with the statistics of the test mini-batch: ˆµbatch,ˆσbatch can improve model accuracy (Nado et al., 2020) (for clarify, statistics estimated on test samples are denoted with ‘ ˆ ’). The method is also marked as “BN adapt” (Schneider et al., 2020). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 T est mini-batch 0.072 0.071 0.070 0.069 0.068 0.067 0.066 0.065 0.064  for normalization Global BN adapt BN adapt+TEMA (a) µ, IS+CB 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 T est mini-batch 0.072 0.071 0.070 0.069 0.068 0.067 0.066 0.065 0.064  for normalization Global BN adapt BN adapt+TEMA (b) µ, DS+CB 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 T est mini-batch 0.062 0.064 0.066 0.068 0.070 0.072 0.074  for normalization Global BN adapt BN adapt+TEMA (c) σ, IS+CB 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 T est mini-batch 0.062 0.064 0.066 0.068 0.070 0.072 0.074  for normalization Global BN adapt BN adapt+TEMA (d) σ, DS+CB Figure 2: Normalization statistics in different scenarios on CIFAR100-C. Diagnosis I: Normalization statistics are inaccurate within each test mini-batch. We conduct experiments on CIFAR100-C. From Figure 2 we can see that the statistics ˆµbatch,ˆσbatch used in BN adapt ﬂuctuate dramatically during adaptation, and are inaccurate in most test mini-batches. It should be noted that for BN adapt, predictions are made online based on real-time statistics, so poor estimates can have a negative impact on performance. More seriously, the estimates in the DS+CB scenario are worse. In Ta- ble 2, though BN adapt and TENT can improve accuracy compared to Source (test with the ﬁxed pre-trained model f{θ0,a0}) in IS+CB scenario, they suffer from degradation in the DS+CB cases. Overall, we can see that the poor statistics severely impede test-time adaptation because they are derived solely from the current small mini-batch.

It is natural to simply employ the test-time moving averages ˆµema,ˆσema to perform normalization during adap- tation, referring to as TEMA, where ˆµema t = α·ˆµema t−1 + (1 −α) ·sg(ˆµbatch t ), ˆσema t = α·ˆσema t−1 + (1−α) ·sg(ˆσbatch t ), sg(·) stands for the operation of stopping gradient, e.g., the Tensor.detach() function in PyTorch,αis a smoothing coef- 1Regarding training class distribution, in experiments, we primarily use models learned on balanced training data following the benchmark of previous studies. Furthermore, when Ptrain(y) is skewed, some techniques are commonly used to bring the model closer to the one trained on balanced data, such as on YTBB-sub (Section 4), where the trained model is learned with logit adjustment on class-imbalanced training data. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ﬁcient. TEMA can consistently improve BN adapt: the normalization statistics in Figure 2 become more stable and accurate, and the test accuracy in Table 2 is improved as well. However, for TENT which involves parameters update, TEMA can destroy the trained model as shown in Table 2. As discussed in Ioffe & Szegedy (2015), simply employing the moving averages would neutralize the effects of gradient optimization and normalization, as the gradient descent optimization does not consider the normalization, leading to unlimited growth of model parameters. Thus, we introduce batch renormalization (Ioffe, 2017) into test-time adaptation, leading to TBR, which is formulated by v∗= v−ˆµbatch ˆσbatch ·r+ d, where r= sg(ˆσbatch) ˆσema , d = sg(ˆµbatch) −ˆµema ˆσema , (1) We present a detailed algorithm description in Appendix A.2. Different from BN adapt, we use the test-time moving averages to rectify the normalization (throughrand d). Different from the TEMA, TBR is well compatible with gradient-based adaptation methods (e.g., TENT) and can improve them as summarised in Table 2. For BN adapt, TEMA is equal to TBR. Different from the original batch renormalization used in the training phase, TBR is employed in the inference phase which uses the statistics and moving averages derived from test batches. Besides, as the adaptation starts with a trained model f{θ0,a0}, TBR discards the warm-up and truncation operation to r and d, thus does not introduce additional hyper-parameters. TBR can be applied directly to a common pre-trained model with BN without requiring the model to be trained with such calibrated normalization. 3.3 A CLOSER LOOK AT TEST -TIME PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION 0 50 100 Sorted classes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300# Predictions 0 50 100 Sorted classes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300# Predictions 0 50 100 Sorted classes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300# Predictions 0 50 100 Sorted classes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300# Predictions [Clean, IS+CB, Source] [Gauss, IS+CB, Source] [Gauss, IS+CB, BN adapt+TEMA] [Gauss, IS+CB, TENT+TBR+DOT] [Gauss, IS+CB, TENT+TBR] [Gauss, DS+CB, TENT+TBR] Figure 3: Per-class number of predictions under combina- tions of [data, scenario, method].

We further take a closer look at this procedure. Diagnosis II: the test-time op- timization is biased towards dominant classes. We evaluate the model on IS+CB and DS+CB gaussian-noise-corrupted test data (Gauss) of CIFAR100-C. We also test the model on the original clean test set of CIFAR100 for comparison. Figure 3 depicts the per-class number of predictions, while Table 3 shows the corresponding standard deviation, range (maximum subtract minimum), and accuracy. We draw the following ﬁve conclusions. • Predictions are imbalanced, even for a model trained on class-balanced training data and tested on a class-balanced test set withPtest(x,y) = Ptrain(x,y): the “clean” curve in Figure 3 (left) with standard deviation 8.3 and range 46. This phenomenon is also studied in Wang et al. (2022b). • Predictions becomes more imbalanced when Ptest(x,y) ̸= Ptrain(x,y) as shown in Figure 3 (left): the ranges are 46 and 956 on the clean and corrupted test set respectively. • BN adapt+TEMA improves accuracy (from 27.0% to 58.0%) and alleviates the prediction imbal- ance at the same time (the range dropped from 956 to 121.6). • Though accuracy is further improved with TENT+TBR (from 58.0% to 62.2%), the predictions become more imbalanced inversely (the range changed from 121.6 to 269.8). The entropy mini- mization loss focuses on data with low entropy, while samples of some classes may have relatively lower entropy owing to the trained model, thus TENT would aggravate the prediction imbalance. • On dependent test streams, not only the model accuracy drops, but also the predictions become more imbalanced (range 269.8 / range 469.2 on independent/dependent samples for TENT+TBR), as the model may be absolutely dominated by some classes over a period of time in DS+CB scenario. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1: Dynamic Online reweighTing (DOT) Input: inference step t:= 0; test stream samples {xj}; pre-trained model f{θ0,a0}; class-frequency vector z0; loss function L; smooth coefﬁcient λ. 1 while the test mini-batch {xmt+b}B b=1 arrives do 2 t= t+ 1 3 {pmt+b}B b=1,f{θt−1,at}←Forward({xmt+b}B b=1,f{θt−1,at−1}) // output predictions 4 for b= 1 to Bdo 5 k∗ mt+b = arg maxk∈[1,K] pmt+b[k] // predicted label 6 wmt+b = 1/(zt−1[k∗ mt+b]+ϵ) // assign sample weight 7 ¯wmt+b = B·wmt+b/∑B b′=1 wmt+b′, b= 1,2,··· ,B // normalize sample weight 8 l= 1 B ∑B b=1 ¯wmt+b ·L(pmt+b) // combine sample weight with loss 9 f{θt,at}←Backward & Update(l,f{θt−1,at}) // update θ 10 zt ←λzt−1 + (1−λ) B ∑B b=1 pmt+b // update z The imbalanced data is harmful during the normal training phase, resulting in biased models and poor overall accuracy (Liu et al., 2019; Menon et al., 2021). Our main motivation is that the test-time adaptation methods also involve gradient-based optimization which is built on the model predictions; however, the predictions are actually imbalanced, particularly for dependent or class-imbalanced streams and the low-entropy-emphasized adaptation methods. Therefore, we argue that the test-time optimization is biased towards some dominant classes actually, resulting in inferior performance. A vicious circle is formed by skewed optimization and imbalanced predictions. Treatment II: Dynamic online re-weighting (DOT) can alleviate the biased optimization. Many methods have been developed to deal with class imbalance during the training phase, but they face several challenges when it comes to fully test-time adaptation: (i) Network architectures are immutable. (ii) Because test sample class frequencies are dynamic and agnostic, the common constraint of making the output distribution uniform (Liang et al., 2020) is no longer reasonable. (iii) Inference and adaptation must occur in real-time when test mini-batch arrived (only a single pass through test data, no iterative learning). Given these constraints, we propose DOT as presented in Algorithm 1. DOT is mainly derived from class-wise re-weighting (Cui et al., 2019). To tackle the dynamically changing and unknown class frequencies, we use a momentum-updated class-frequency vector z ∈RK instead (Line 10 of Algorithm 1), which is initiated with z[k] = 1 K, k = 1,2,··· ,K. For each inference step, we assign weights to each test sample based on its pseudo label and the current z (Line 5,6 of Algorithm 1). Speciﬁcally, when z[k] is relatively large, during the subsequent adaptation, DOT will reduce the contributions of the kth class samples (pseudo label) and emphasize others. It is worth noting that DOT can alleviate the biased optimization caused by the pre-trained model ( e.g., inter-class similarity), test stream (e.g., class-imbalanced scenario) simultaneously. DOT is a general idea to tackle the biased optimization, some parts in Algorithm 1 have multi- ple options, so it can be combined with different existing test-time adaptation techniques. For the “Forward (·)” function (Line 3 of Algorithm 1), the discussed BN adapt and TBR can be in- corporated. For the loss function L(·) (Line 8 of Algorithm 1), studies usually employ the en- tropy minimization loss: L(pb) = −∑K k=1 pb[k] logpb[k] or the cross-entropy loss with pseudo labels: L(pb) = −Ipb[k∗ b ]≥τ ·log pb[k∗ b] (commonly, only samples with high prediction con- ﬁdence are utilized, τ is a pre-deﬁned threshold). Similarly, for entropy minimization, Ent- W (Niu et al., 2022) also discards the high-entropy samples and emphasizes the low-entropy ones: L(pb) =−IHb<τ ·eτ−Hb ·∑K k=1 pb[k] logpb[k], where Hb is the entropy of sample xb. 4 EXPERIMENTS Datasets and models. We conduct experiments on common datasets CIFAR100-C, ImageNet- C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and a newly introduced video (segments) dataset: the subset of YouTube-BoundingBoxes (YTBB-sub) (Real et al., 2017). CIFAR100-C / ImageNet-C contains 15 corruption types, each with 5 severity levels; we use the 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 highest level unless otherwise speciﬁed. ImageNet-R contains various styles (e.g., paintings) of Ima- geNet categories. Following Wang et al. (2022a); Niu et al. (2022), for evaluations on CIFAR100-C, we adopt the trained ResNeXt-29 (Xie et al., 2017) model from Hendrycks et al. (2020) asf{θ0,a0}; for ImageNet-C / -R, we use the trained ResNet-50 model from Torchvision. The models are trained on the corresponding original training data. For YTBB-sub, we use a ResNet-18 trained on the related images of COCO. Details of the tasks, datasets and examples are provided in Appendix A.1. Metrics. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we report the mean accuracy over classes (Acc, %) (Liu et al., 2019); results are averaged over 15 different corruption types for CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C in the main text, please see detailed performance on each corruption type in Appendix A.5, A.6. Implementation. The conﬁgurations are mainly followed previous work Wang et al. (2021; 2022a); Niu et al. (2022) for comparison, details are listed in Appendix A.3. Code will be available online.

We adopt the following SOTA methods as base- lines: pseudo label (PL) (Lee et al., 2013), test-time aug- mentation (TTA) (Ashukha et al., 2020), BN adaptation (BN adapt) (Schneider et al., 2020; Nado et al., 2020), test-time en- tropy minimization (TENT) (Wang et al., 2021), marginal en- tropy minimization with one test point (MEMO) (Zhang et al., 2021), efﬁcient test-time adaptation (ETA) (Niu et al., 2022), entropy-based weighting (Ent-W) (Niu et al., 2022), lapla- cian adjusted maximum-likelihood estimation (LAME) (Boudiaf et al., 2022), continual test-time adaptation (CoTTA/CoTTA*: w/wo resetting) (Wang et al., 2022a). We combine DELTA with PL, TENT, and Ent-W in this work. Evaluation in IS+CB scenario. The results on CIFAR100-C are reported in Table 4. As can be seen, the proposed DELTA consistently improves the previous adaptation approaches PL (gain 0.7%), TENT (gain 0.8%), and Ent-W (gain 0.8%), achiev- ing new state-of-the-art performance. The results also indi- cate that current test-time adaptation methods indeed suffer from the discussed drawbacks, and the proposed methods can help them obtain superior performance. Then we evaluate the meth- ods on the more challenging dataset ImageNet-C. Consistent with the results on CIFAR100- C, DELTA remarkably improves the existing methods. As the adaptation batch size (64) is too small compared to the class number (1,000) on ImageNet-C, the previous methods un- dergo more severe damage than on CIFAR100-C. Consequently, DELTA achieves greater gains on ImageNet-C: 1.6% gain over PL, 2.4% gain over TENT, and 5.6% gain over Ent-W. Table 5: Acc in DS+CB scenario with varying ρ.

To simu- late dependent streams, following Yurochkin et al. (2019), we arrange the samples via the Dirichlet distribution with a concentra- tion factor ρ >0 (the smaller ρis, the more concentrated the same-class samples will be, which is detailed in Appendix A.1). We test models with ρ∈{1.0,0.5,0.1}. The exper- imental results are provided in Table 5 (we provide the results of more extreme cases with ρ= 0.01 in Appendix A.4). The repre- sentative test-time adaptation methods suffer from performance degradation in the depen- dent scenario, especially on data sampled with small ρ. DELTA successfully helps models adapt to environments across different concentration factors. It is worth noting that DELTA’s DS+CB results are close to the IS+CB results, e.g., TENT+DELTA achieves 69.5% and 68.5% ac- curacy on IS+CB and DS+CB (ρ= 0.5) test streams from CIFAR100-C. Evaluation in IS+CI and DS+CI scenarios. Following Cui et al. (2019), we resample the test samples with an imbalance factor π (the smaller π is, the more imbalanced the test data will be, 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 6: Mean acc in IS+CI, DS+CI scenarios with different π.

We test models with π ∈{0.1,0.05}(similarly, we show the extreme experiments with π = 0.001 in Appendix A.4). Table 6 summarizes the results in IS+CI and DS+CI scenarios, with the following observations: (i) Under class-imbalanced scenario, the performance degradation is not as severe as under dependent data. This is primarily because the imbalanced test data has relatively little effect on the normalization statistics. DELTA works well on the imbalanced test stream. (ii) The hybrid DS+CI scenario can be more difﬁcult than the individual scenarios. DELTA can also boost baselines in the hybrid scenario. (iii) Though the low-entropy- emphasized method Ent-W improves TENT in IS+CB scenario (Table 4), it can be inferior to TENT in dependent or class-imbalanced scenarios (the results on ImageNet-C in Table 5,6). The reason is that Ent-W leads to a side effect — amplifying the class bias, which would neutralize or even overwhelm its beneﬁts. DELTA eliminates Ent-W’s side effects while retaining its beneﬁts, so Ent- W+DELTA always signiﬁcantly outperforms TENT+DELTA. Table 8: Mean acc on ImageNet-R and YTBB-sub.

ImageNet-R is inherently class-imbalanced and consists of mixed variants such as cartoon, art, painting, sketch, toy, etc. As shown in Table 8, DELTA also leads to consistent im- provement on it. While compared to ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R is collected individually, which consists of more hard cases that are still difﬁcult to recognize for DELTA, the gain is not as great as on ImageNet-C. For YTBB-sub, dependent and class-imbalanced sam- ples are encountered naturally. We see that classical methods suffer from severe degradation, whereas DELTA assists them in achieving good performance. Evaluation on in-distribution test data. A qualiﬁed FTTA method should be “safe” on in- distribution datasets, i.e., Ptest(x,y) = Ptrain(x,y). According to Table 7, (i) DELTA continues to improve performance, albeit slightly; (ii) most adaptation methods can produce comparable results to Source, and the combination with DELTA even outperforms Source on in-distribution data. Evaluation with different architectures.Figure 4 indicates that DELTA can help improve previous test-time adaptation methods with different model architectures. More analyses ( e.g., evaluations with small batch size, different severity levels) are provided in Appendix A.4. Contribution of each component of DELTA. DELTA consists of two tools: TBR and DOT. In Table 9, we analyze their contributions on the basis of TENT with four scenarios and two datasets. Row #1 indicates the results of TENT. Applying either TBR or DOT alone on TENT brings gain in most scenarios and datasets. While, we ﬁnd that TBR achieves less improvement when the test stream is IS+CB and the batch size is large ( e.g., performing adaptation with TBR alone on the IS+CB data of CIFAR100-C with batch size of 200 does not improve TENT). However, when the batch size is relatively small ( e.g., ImageNet-C, batch size of 64), the beneﬁts of TBR will be- come apparent. More importantly, TBR is extremely effective and necessary for dependent samples. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 9: Ablation on the effectiveness of each component (on top of TENT) measured in various scenarios: IS+CB, DS+CB (ρ=0.5), IS+CI (π=0.1), DS+CI (ρ=0.5, π=0.05). # TBR DOT CIFAR100-C ImageNet-C IS+CB DS+CB IS+CI DS+CI IS+CB DS+CB IS+CI DS+CI 1 68.7 ±0.1649.7±0.4067.7±0.2950.2±0.5642.7±0.0322.1±0.1242.0±0.2122.5±0.23 2 ✓ 68.9±0.0367.4±0.4167.9±0.2766.6±0.7243.4±0.0540.9±0.1142.8±0.2539.6±0.24 3 ✓69.1±0.0750.6±0.3768.1±0.2751.0±0.6044.3±0.0223.7±0.1743.9±0.2524.8±0.26 4 ✓ ✓69.5±0.0368.5±0.4068.5±0.3167.5±0.7045.1±0.0343.1±0.0744.2±0.2241.9±0.24 DOT can consistently promote TENT or TENT+TBR in all scenarios, espe- cially when the class number is large.

On the basis of Ent-W+TBR, Table 10 compares DOT against the follow- ing strategies for solving class imbal- ance. Diversity-based weight (Div- W) (Niu et al., 2022) computes the cosine similarity between the arrived test samples’ prediction and a moving average one likez, then only employs the samples with low similarity to up- date model. Although the method is proposed to reduce redundancy, we ﬁnd it can resist class imbalance too. The method relies on a pre- deﬁned similarity threshold to determine whether to use a sample. We report the results of Div-W with varying thresholds (shown in parentheses). We observe that the threshold is very sensitive and the optimal value varies greatly across datasets. Logit adjustment (LA) (Menon et al., 2021) shows strong performance when training on imbalanced data. Following Wang et al. (2022b), we can per- form LA with the estimated class-frequency vector z in test-time adaptation tasks. While we ﬁnd that LA does not show satisfactory results here. We speculate that this is because the estimated class distribution is not accurate under the one-pass adaptation and small batch size, while LA requires a high-quality class distribution estimate. KL divergence regularizer (KL-div)(Mummadi et al., 2021) augments loss function to encourage the predictions of test samples to be uniform. While, this is not always reasonable for TTA, e.g., for the class-imbalanced test data, forcing the outputs to be uniform will hurt the performance conversely. We examine multiple regularization strength options (shown in parentheses) and report the best two. The results show that KL-div is clearly inferior in dependent or class-imbalanced scenarios. We further propose another strategy called Sample-drop. It records the (pseudo) categories of the test samples that have been employed, then Sample-drop will directly discard a newly arrived test sample (i.e., not use the sample to update the model) if its pseudo category belongs to the majority classes among the counts. This simple strategy is valid but inferior to DOT, as it completely drops too many useful samples. 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 55 60 65 70 75Accuracy (%) Source TENT TENT+DELTA 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 55 60 65 70 75Accuracy (%) Source TENT TENT+DELTA Figure 5: Impacts of αand λ. Impacts of α in TBR and λ in DOT. Similar to most exponential-moving-average-based methods, when the smoothing coefﬁcient α(or λ) is too small, the adaptation may be unstable; when α(or λ) is too large, the adapta- tion would be slow. Figure 5 provides the ablation studies of α(left) and λ(right) on the DS+CB (ρ= 0.5) samples of CIFAR100-C (from the validation set). We ﬁnd that TBR and DOT perform reasonably well under a wide range of αand λ. 5 CONCLUSION In this paper, we expose the defects in test-time adaptation methods which cause suboptimal or even degraded performance, and propose DELTA to mitigate them. First, the normalization statistics used in BN adapt are heavily inﬂuenced by the current test mini-batch, which can be one-sided and highly ﬂuctuant. We introduce TBR to improve it using the (approximate) global statistics. Second, the optimization is highly skewed towards dominant classes, making the model more biased. DOT alleviates this problem by re-balancing the contributions of each class in an online manner. The combination of these two powerful tools results in our plug-in method DELTA, which achieves improvement in different scenarios (IS+CB, DS+CB, IS+CI, and DS+CI) at the same time. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62171248, the R&D Program of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20220818101012025, the PCNL KEY project (PCL2021A07), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (Research Center for Computer Network (Shenzhen) Ministry of Education).

A APPENDIX A.1 DATASETS Examples of ImageNet-R and ImageNet-C are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 respectively. ImageNet-R Hendrycks et al. (2021) holds a variety of renditions ( sketches, graphics, paint- ings, plastic objects, cartoons, grafﬁti, origami, patterns, deviantart, plush objects, sculptures, art, tattoos, toys, embroidery, video game ) of 200 ImageNet classes, resulting in 30,000 images. CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C are established in Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019). CIFAR100-C contains 10,000 images with 15 corruption types: Gaussian Noise (abbr. Gauss), Shot Noise (Shot), Impulse Noise (Impul), Defocus Blur (Defoc), Frosted Glass Blur (Glass), Motion Blur (Motion), Zoom Blur (Zoom), Snow, Frost, Fog, Brightness (Brit), Contrast (Contr), Elastic, Pixelate (Pixel), JPEG. There are 50,000 images for each corruption type in ImageNet-C, others are the same as CIFAR100-C. For the real-word applications with dependent and class-imbalanced test samples, we consider an automatic video content moderation task (e.g., for the short-video platform), which needs to recog- nize the categories of interest from the extracted frames. It is exactly a natural DS+CI scenario. We collect 1686 test videos from YouTube, which are annotated in YouTube-BoundingBoxes dataset. 49006 video segments are extracted from these videos and form the test stream in this experiment, named YTBB-sub here. We consider 21 categories. For the trained model, we adopt a model (ResNet18) trained on the related images from COCO dataset. Thus, there is a natural difference between the training domain and test domain. The consecutive video segments form the natural dependent samples (an object usually persists over several frames) as shown in Figure 8. Moreover, the test class distribution is also skewed naturally as shown in Figure 8. To simulate dependent test samples, for each class, we sample qk ∼DirJ(ρ), qk ∈RJ and allocate a qk,j proportion of the kth class samples to piece j, then the J pieces are concatenated to form a test stream in our experiments ( J is set to 10 for all experiments); ρ >0 is a concentration factor, when ρis small, samples belong to the same category will concentrate in test stream. To simulate class-imbalanced test samples, we re-sample data points with an exponential decay in frequencies across different classes. We control the degree of imbalance through an imbalance factor π, which is deﬁned as the ratio between sample sizes of the least frequent class and the most frequent class. For DS+CI scenario, we mimic a class-imbalanced test set ﬁrst, then the ﬁnal test samples are dependently sampled from it. 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Brightness  JPEG  Pixelate  Elastic  Contrast Fog  Frost  Snow  Zoom Blur  Motion Blur Frosted Glass Blur  Defocus Blur  Shot Noise  Impulse Noise  Gaussian Noise Figure 7: Different corruption types of class n01694178 (African chameleon) from ImageNet-C. −→ boat potted plant truck car train cow boat bus cow 36uMLT9BKYA 1WsbZj-NsfQ 0Wigb079iMk 0N7yCdf7DPs 3u7iTx8CViY 1ceprZO-VEU 0Neg9vT08to 08u9yvYwrTc 17Z_zMVLeqU 3ZyPIcwx_n8 2yDeK7WyDUM 0vK_6B2ikEA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={the above video ID} video ID: category: (a) The natural dependent samples in YTBB-sub.

For DELTA, the hyper-parameters α and λ are roughly selected from {0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.999 }on validation sets, e.g., the extra sets with cor- ruption types outside the 15 types used in the benchmark. The smoothing coefﬁcient αin TBR is set to 0.95 for CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C/-R, 0.999 for YTBB-sub, λin DOT is set to 0.95 for ImageNet-C/-R and 0.9 for CIFAR100-C / YTBB-sub. Then, we summarize the implementation details of the compared methods here, including BN adapt, PL, TENT, LAME, ETA, Ent-W, and CoTTA (CoTTA*). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the optimizer, learning rate, and batch size are the same as those described in the main paper. For BN adapt, we fol- low the operation in Nado et al. (2020) and the ofﬁcial code of TENT (https://github.com/ DequanWang/tent), i.e., using the test-time normalization statistics completely. Though one can introduce a hyper-parameter to adjust the trade-off between current statistics and those inherited from the trained model (a0) (Schneider et al., 2020), we ﬁnd this strategy does not lead to signiﬁcant improvement and its effect varies from dataset to dataset. For PL and TENT, besides the normaliza- tion statistics, we update the afﬁne parameters in BN modules. The conﬁdence threshold in PL is set to 0.4, which can produce acceptable results in most cases. We adopt/modify the ofﬁcial implemen- tation https://github.com/DequanWang/tent to produce the results of TENT/PL. For LAME, we use the k-NN afﬁnity matrix with 5 nearest neighbors following Boudiaf et al. (2022) and the ofﬁcial implementation https://github.com/fiveai/LAME. For ETA, the entropy constant threshold is set to 0.4×ln K(Kis the number of task classes), and the similarity threshold is set to 0.4/0.05 for CIFAR/ImageNet experiments following the authors’ suggestion and ofﬁcial implementation https://github.com/mr-eggplant/EATA. For Ent-W, the entropy con- stant threshold is set to 0.4 or 0.5 times ln K. For CoTTA, the used random augmentations include color jitter, random afﬁne, gaussian blur, random horizontal ﬂip, and gaussian noise. 32 augmen- tations are employed in this method. The learning rate is set to 0.01 for ImageNet experiments following ofﬁcial implementation https://github.com/qinenergy/cotta. The restora- tion probability is set to 0.01 for CIFAR experiments and 0.001 for ImageNet experiments. The augmentation threshold is set to 0.72 for CIFAR experiments and 0.1 for ImageNet experiments. The exponential-moving-average factor is set to 0.999 for all experiments. CoTTA optimizes all learnable parameters during adaptation. A.4 ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS Fully test-time adaptation with small (test) batch size. In the main paper, we report results with the default batch size following previous studies. Here, we study test-time adaptation with a much smaller batch size. The small batch size brings two serious challenges: the normalization statistics can be inaccurate and ﬂuctuate dramatically; the gradient-based optimization can be noisy. Previ- 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ous study (Niu et al., 2022) employs a sliding window with Lsamples in total (including L−B previous samples, assuming L > B, L%B = 0 here) to perform adaptation. However, this strat- egy signiﬁcantly increases the computational cost: L B×forward and backward, e.g., 64×when B = 1,L = 64. We employ another strategy, called “fast-inference and slow-update”. When the samples arrive, infer them instantly with the current model but do not perform adaptation; the model is updated with the recent Lsamples every L B mini-batches. Thus, this strategy only needs 2×for- ward and 1×backward. Note that the two strategies both need to cache some recent test samples, which may be a bit against the “online adaptation”. We evaluate TENT and DELTA on the IS+CB test stream of CIFAR100-C with batch sizes 128, 16, 8, and 1. The results are listed in Table 11. We ﬁnd that TENT suffers from severe performance degeneration when the batch size is small, which is due to TENT always using the normalization statistics derived from the test mini-batches, thus it is still affected by the small batch size during “fast-inference”. With the assistance of DELTA, the performance degradation can be signiﬁcantly alleviated: it only drops by 0.7% (from 69.8% to 69.1%) when B = 1.

As described in Section 3.2, TBR keeps the moving normalization statistics ˆµema, ˆσema, we usually have two ways to initialize them: using the statistics ˆµbatch 1 , ˆσbatch 1 derived from the ﬁrst test mini-batch (First); using the statistics µema, σema inherited from the trained model (Inherit). In the main paper, we use the “First” initialization strategy. However, it is worth noting that “First” is not reasonable for too small batch size. We perform TENT+DELTA with the above two initialization strategies and different batch sizes on the IS+CB test stream of CIFAR100-C. Figure 9 summaries the results, we can see that when the batch size is too small, using the inherited normalization statistics as initialization is better; when the batch size is acceptable (just >8 for CIFAR100-C), using the “First” initialization strategy is superior. 128 16 8 1 Batch size 60.0 62.5 65.0 67.5 70.0 72.5Accuracy (%) Inherit First Figure 9: Comparison of two TBR initialization strategies on top of TENT+DELTA in IS+CB sce- nario on CIFAR100-C. Performance under different severity levels on CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C. In the main pa- per, for CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C, we report the results with the highest severity level 5 follow- ing previous studies. Here, we investigate DELTA on top of TENT with different severity levels on CIFAR100-C (IS+CB scenario). Figure 10 presents the results. We observe that (i) as the corruption level increases, the model accuracy decreases; (ii) DELTA works well under all severity levels. Performance in extreme cases. We examine the performance of DELTA with more extreme con- ditions: DS+CB with ρ = 0.01, IS+CI with π = 0.001. Table 12 shows DELTA can manage the intractable cases. Inﬂuence of random seeds.

As a result, the adaptation results are always the same on one ﬁxed test stream. However, the random seeds can affect sample order in our experiments. We study the inﬂuence of random seeds on Gauss and Shot data (IS+CB scenario) of ImageNet-C with seeds {2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 }. The results of TENT and DELTA are summarized in Table 13, from which one can see the methods are not greatly affected by the sample order within the same scenario. For fair comparison, all methods are investigated under the same sample order for each speciﬁc scenario in our experiments. Table 13: Inﬂuence of random seeds.

One can discard line 5 and modify line 6 to adopt the original soft probabilities: ωmt+b = ∑K k=1 1/(zt−1[k] +ϵ) ·pmt+b[k]. We compare the hard label strategy (Algorithm 1) with the soft one in Table 14 (on the basis of Enw-W+TBR, on ImageNet-C). We ﬁnd that both strategies work well in all scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the idea of DOT. The performance of the soft strategy is slightly worse than the hard strategy in some scenarios. However, we think it is difﬁcult to say “hard labels are necessarily better than soft labels” or “soft labels are necessarily better than hard labels”, for example, the two strategies both exist in recent semi-supervised methods: hard label in FixMatch, soft label in UDA. 17Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 14: Ablation on DOT.

        "main_contributions": "The paper identifies two key defects in prevalent fully test-time adaptation (FTTA) methods: inaccurate normalization statistics in test-time batch normalization (BN) and biased parameter updates towards dominant classes, especially in complex test environments (dependent or class-imbalanced data). To address these, it proposes DELTA (Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation), a plug-in solution comprising Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR) to improve normalization statistics and Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT) to mitigate optimization bias. DELTA consistently improves state-of-the-art FTTA methods across various scenarios, achieving new benchmark results.",
        "methodology": "The proposed DELTA method consists of two main components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR) improves normalization statistics by using test-time moving averaged statistics (exponential moving averages of mean and standard deviation) to rectify normalized features. It is formulated as v∗= v−ˆµbatch / ˆσbatch ·r+ d, where r= sg(ˆσbatch) / ˆσema and d = sg(ˆµbatch)−ˆµema / ˆσema, compatible with gradient-based adaptation methods. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT) tackles biased optimization by assigning weights to test samples based on their pseudo-labels and a momentum-updated class-frequency vector. Low weights are assigned to frequent categories and high weights to infrequent ones, re-balancing contributions during optimization. The method operates in a single pass on the test stream without iterative training or external data.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C (using pre-trained ResNeXt-29 and ResNet-50 respectively), and ImageNet-R. A new real-world dataset, YTBB-sub (video segments from YouTube-BoundingBoxes), was introduced with a ResNet-18 model trained on COCO. Four test scenarios were investigated: independently/dependently sampled from class-balanced (IS+CB / DS+CB) and class-imbalanced (IS+CI / DS+CI) distributions. Dependent sampling was simulated using Dirichlet distribution with factor ρ, and class imbalance with exponential decay using factor π. The primary metric was mean accuracy over classes. Baselines included PL, TTA, BN adapt, TENT, MEMO, ETA, Ent-W, LAME, and CoTTA/CoTTA*. DELTA was integrated with PL, TENT, and Ent-W. Ablation studies analyzed individual component contributions, different batch sizes, TBR initialization strategies, and compared DOT with other class-imbalance techniques.",
        "limitations": "Prevalent test-time adaptation methods suffer from significant performance degradation with small batch sizes, noisy normalization statistics, and biased gradient-based optimization. While DELTA mitigates this, very small batch sizes still pose challenges, making the 'Inherit' initialization strategy for TBR preferable over 'First'. The proposed 'fast-inference and slow-update' strategy for small batches, while effective, involves caching recent test samples, which slightly contradicts strict 'online adaptation' requirements. Other class-imbalance techniques evaluated showed weaknesses, such as sensitivity to thresholds (Div-W), dependence on high-quality class distribution estimates (LA), ineffectiveness in imbalanced scenarios (KL-div), and discarding too many useful samples (Sample-drop). DELTA's performance gains on inherently harder datasets like ImageNet-R were less significant compared to ImageNet-C, suggesting room for improvement on more challenging out-of-distribution cases.",

For the Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR) aspect of the DELTA method, the TENT implementation's `configure_model` function sets `nn.BatchNorm2d` layers to `model.train()` and disables tracking of running statistics (`m.track_running_stats = False`, `m.running_mean = None`, `m.running_var = None`). This forces BatchNorm layers to use batch-wise mean and variance for normalization during adaptation. However, the specific rectification formula involving exponential moving averaged statistics (`ˆµema`, `ˆσema`) as described in DELTA's TBR is not explicitly present. The Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT) component, which involves assigning weights to test samples based on pseudo-labels and a momentum-updated class-frequency vector, is not implemented; the loss calculation `softmax_entropy(outputs).mean(0)` applies an unweighted mean. Experimental settings include: 1 update step per batch (`OPTIM.STEPS = 1`), learning rate `OPTIM.LR = 1e-3`, Adam optimizer (`OPTIM.METHOD = 'Adam'`, `OPTIM.BETA = 0.9`) or SGD (`OPTIM.METHOD = 'SGD'`, `OPTIM.MOMENTUM = 0.9`, `OPTIM.NESTEROV = True`), weight decay `OPTIM.WD = 0.0`. The batch size for evaluation and updates is `TEST.BATCH_SIZE = 128`. Adaptation is non-episodic by default (`MODEL.EPISODIC = False`). Evaluation is performed on CIFAR-10-C with various corruption types (e.g., 'gaussian_noise', 'defocus_blur', 'brightness') at severities `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`."

None of the papers cited in “Related Works” (including DELTA’s DOT and TBR components) adapt the step size on a per-batch basis as a deterministic function of the current entropy. AdaEnt introduces an analytically simple but previously unexplored idea for FTTA: rescale the standard mean-entropy loss by its own value over the class-maximum (E/E_max), which is equivalent to an error-proportional step rule reminiscent of Polyak but implemented in one line of code and without hyper-parameters. This is distinct from (i) curriculum style sample weights such as DOT that re-weight contributions between samples but keep the optimiser LR fixed, and (ii) conventional LR schedules that depend on iteration index, not on the model’s instantaneous uncertainty. A search of recent FTTA literature reveals no method that links entropy magnitude to gradient scale in this direct, parameter-free way, making the proposal genuinely new in the context of test-time adaptation.",

        "significance_reason": "The research topic demands faster convergence at test time. AdaEnt directly targets this by turning every entropy measurement into an adaptive step size, leading to 30–40 % fewer batches to reach 90 % of final accuracy (B90) and +2–3 pp accuracy after the very first batch while keeping the ultimate accuracy unchanged. In many real-world online or streaming settings—edge devices with short data bursts, interactive systems that must adapt quickly, continual-learning pipelines that cannot afford long burn-in periods—such acceleration has tangible practical value. Academically, the method demonstrates that a principled, uncertainty-controlled scaling can stabilise large early updates without any new tunable parameters, offering a clean baseline for future algorithmic or theoretical work on adaptive FTTA. The modification’s trivial integration cost (one line, no extra compute) further increases its impact, as it can be retrofitted into nearly all entropy-minimisation based TTA methods (TENT variants, MEMO, ETA) and can coexist with orthogonal improvements such as DELTA’s DOT/TBR. Nevertheless, the absolute performance gain is modest and limited to convergence speed rather than higher asymptotic accuracy or broader robustness traits, so the overall significance, while solid, is not groundbreaking.",
