Input:
# Task
You carefully read the contents of the “Paper Outline” and select one GitHub link from the “GitHub URLs List” that you think is most relevant to the contents.
# Constraints
- Output the index number corresponding to the selected GitHub URL.
- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
The proposed DELTA method consists of two main components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR) improves normalization statistics by using test-time moving averaged statistics (exponential moving averages of mean and standard deviation) to rectify normalized features. It is formulated as v∗= v−ˆµbatch / ˆσbatch ·r+ d, where r= sg(ˆσbatch) / ˆσema and d = sg(ˆµbatch)−ˆµema / ˆσema, compatible with gradient-based adaptation methods. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT) tackles biased optimization by assigning weights to test samples based on their pseudo-labels and a momentum-updated class-frequency vector. Low weights are assigned to frequent categories and high weights to infrequent ones, re-balancing contributions during optimization. The method operates in a single pass on the test stream without iterative training or external data.
