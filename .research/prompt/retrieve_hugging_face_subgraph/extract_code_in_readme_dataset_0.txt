Input:
From the Hugging Face README provided in “# README,” extract and output only the Python code required for execution. Do not output any other information. In particular, if no implementation method is described, output an empty string.

# Dataset Card for CIFAR10-C

<!-- Provide a quick summary of the dataset. -->

This dataset is simply an update of the original dataset into the parquet format which should work with the current (circa 2025) huggingface dataset library

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->
The CIFAR-10-C dataset is an extension of CIFAR-10 designed to evaluate model robustness to common corruptions. It consists of 950,000 images derived from the original CIFAR-10 test set (10,000 images) by applying 19 different corruption types at 5 severity levels. The corruptions include noise, blur, weather effects, and digital distortions. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking robustness in image classification tasks.

### Dataset Sources

<!-- Provide the basic links for the dataset. -->

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness
- **Paper:** Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. (2019). Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261.

## Dataset Structure

<!-- This section provides a description of the dataset fields, and additional information about the dataset structure such as criteria used to create the splits, relationships between data points, etc. -->

Each sample in the dataset contains:

- **image**: A 32×32 RGB image in PNG format

- **label**: An integer between 0 and 9, representing the class

- **corruption_name**: The name of the applied corruption

- **corruption_level**: An integer between 1 and 5 indicating severity


Total images: 950,000

Classes: 10 (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)

Corruptions: 19 types (e.g., Gaussian noise, motion blur, contrast, fog, frost, elastic transform, pixelate, JPEG compression, etc.)

Severity Levels: 5 (ranging from least to most severe)

Splits:

- **Train**: 950,000 images

Image specs: PNG format, 32×32 pixels, RGB

## Example Usage
Below is a quick example of how to load this dataset via the Hugging Face Datasets library.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("robro/cifar10-c-parquet", split="train", trust_remote_code=False)
classes = ["airplane","automobile","bird","cat","deer","dog","frog","horse","ship","truck",]

# Access a sample from the dataset
example = dataset[0]
image = example["image"]
label = example["label"]

image.show()  # Display the image
print(f"Label: {classes[label]}")
```

## Citation

<!-- If there is a paper or blog post introducing the dataset, the APA and Bibtex information for that should go in this section. -->

**BibTeX:**
