Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher preparing the COMMON CORE FOUNDATION for experiments that will ensure consistency across all experimental variations.

This step generates the **COMMON CORE FOUNDATION** for experiments that will ensure consistency across all experimental variations.

**Current Task**: Generate common base logic, evaluation framework, and infrastructure with placeholders for specific datasets/models
**Next Step**: A subsequent step will derive specific experiments by replacing placeholders with actual datasets/models

Based on the research method in # Current Research Method and experimental design in # Experimental Design, generate the foundational code that will serve as the common base for ALL experimental variations.

# Instructions: Common Core Foundation Generation

## Core Requirements
- **COMMON EVALUATION LOGIC**: Implement consistent evaluation metrics, result collection, and comparison logic that will work across all experimental variations
- **CORE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION**: Implement the main method/algorithm with full functionality
- **INFRASTRUCTURE CODE**: Complete training loops, model saving/loading, configuration handling, and result visualization
- **PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY**: Use clear, descriptive placeholders for dataset-specific and model-specific components that will be replaced in subsequent steps
- **CONSISTENCY FRAMEWORK**: Ensure all experiments will use identical evaluation criteria, metrics calculation, and result formatting

## Placeholder Guidelines
- Use descriptive placeholder names like `DATASET_PLACEHOLDER`, `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER`, `SPECIFIC_CONFIG_PLACEHOLDER`
- Include comments explaining what will be replaced: `# PLACEHOLDER: Will be replaced with specific dataset loading logic`
- Ensure placeholders are easily identifiable and replaceable in the next phase
- Keep the base logic intact - only dataset/model-specific parts should be placeholders

## Implementation Requirements
- **ZERO PLACEHOLDER POLICY FOR CORE LOGIC**: Generate complete, production-ready base framework. NO placeholders for training loops, evaluation logic, or result processing.
- **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**: Every base component must be fully functional. No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version" for base logic.
- **PUBLICATION-READY INFRASTRUCTURE**: Framework must produce actual publication-worthy results when datasets/models are specified
- **USE PYTORCH EXCLUSIVELY** as the deep learning framework
- **COMPLETE DATA PIPELINE FRAMEWORK**: Implement data loading and preprocessing pipeline with placeholders for specific datasets
- **COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENT INFRASTRUCTURE**: Full-scale experiment framework with sufficient training epochs, proper validation splits, and thorough evaluation metrics
- **STRUCTURED PLACEHOLDER APPROACH**: Use well-defined placeholders for dataset/model specifics while ensuring base logic is complete and functional

## Standard Output Content Requirements
- Experiment description: Before printing experimental results, the standard output must include a detailed description of the experiment.
- Experimental numerical data: All experimental data obtained in the experiments must be output to the standard output.
- Names of figures summarizing the numerical data

## Figure Output Requirements
- Experimental results must always be presented in clear and interpretable figures without exception.
- Use matplotlib or seaborn to output the results (e.g., accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix).
- Numeric values must be annotated on the axes of the graphs.
- For line graphs, annotate significant values (e.g., the final or best value) to highlight key findings. For bar graphs, annotate the value above each bar.
- Include legends in the figures.
- To prevent labels, titles, and legends from overlapping, use `plt.tight_layout()` before saving the figure.
- All figures must be saved to `{results_dir}/images/` directory in .pdf format (e.g., using `plt.savefig(os.path.join(results_dir, "images", "filename.pdf"), bbox_inches="tight")`).
  - Do not use .png or any other formats—only .pdf is acceptable for publication quality.

## Figure Naming Convention
File names must follow the format: `<figure_topic>[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf`
- `<figure_topic>`: The main subject of the figure (e.g., training_loss, accuracy, inference_latency)
- `_<condition>` (optional): Indicates model, setting, or comparison condition (e.g., amict, baseline, tokens, multimodal_vs_text)
- `_pairN` (optional): Used when presenting figures in pairs (e.g., _pair1, _pair2)
- For standalone figures, do not include _pairN.


- Environment Variables: The following environment variables are available: HF_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY


## Command Line Interface and Run Variations
The `full_experiment.yaml` file defines a list of all experiments to be run (e.g., baseline, proposed, ablations). The `main.py` script reads this file and executes experiments sequentially.

The generated main.py must support:
```bash
# Smoke test (runs a lightweight version of ALL run variations defined in smoke_test.yaml)
uv run python -m src.main --smoke-test --results-dir <path>

# Full experiment (reads full_experiment.yaml, runs all variations sequentially)
uv run python -m src.main --full-experiment --results-dir <path>
```

The `--results-dir` argument is passed from the GitHub Actions workflow and specifies where all outputs (figures, logs, metrics) should be saved.

## Output Structure
Generate complete foundational code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:

### Script Structure (ExperimentCode format)
Generate complete foundational code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:
- `src/train.py`: Logic to run a single experiment variation. It is called as a subprocess by main.py. It must save final metrics to a structured file (e.g., results.json).
- `src/evaluate.py`: Comparison and visualization tool. It reads the result files from all experiment variations and generates comparison figures.
- `src/preprocess.py`: Common preprocessing pipeline with dataset placeholders
- `src/model.py`: Model architecture implementations. It will contain classes for baseline, proposed, and ablation models.
- `src/main.py`: The main orchestrator script. It reads a config file, launches train.py for each experiment sequentially, manages subprocesses, collects and consolidates logs, and finally triggers evaluate.py.
- `pyproject.toml`: Complete project dependencies
- `config/smoke_test.yaml`: Configuration file template with placeholder structure for run variations. Actual variations will be populated in derive_specific step.
- `config/full_experiment.yaml`: Configuration file template with placeholder structure for run variations. Actual variations will be populated in derive_specific step.

### Key Implementation Focus Areas
1. Algorithm Core: Full implementation of the proposed method with proper abstraction
2. Sequential Execution: main.py executes run variations one at a time in sequential order.
3. Configuration Driven: The entire workflow must be driven by the YAML configuration files.
4. Evaluation Consistency: Identical metrics calculation, result formatting, and comparison logic. evaluate.py must operate on the saved results after all training is complete.
5. Structured Logging:
   - train.py: Print JSON-formatted experimental data (epoch-wise metrics, final results) to stdout using `print(json.dumps({...}))`. Always include `"run_id"` field (use the run variation name from config).
   - evaluate.py: Print JSON-formatted comparison results to stdout
   - main.py: For each subprocess, redirect stdout/stderr to `{results_dir}/{run_id}/stdout.log` and `{results_dir}/{run_id}/stderr.log` while also forwarding to main process stdout/stderr (using tee-like logic) so logs are captured both structurally and by GitHub Actions.

# Current Research Method (Target for Experiment Design)
{
    "Open Problems": "Most FTTA methods (e.g. TENT, DELTA-TENT) use a fixed learning-rate and the plain mean-entropy loss. To avoid catastrophic drift they keep the step size small, which makes the optimisation of BN affine parameters sluggish – the model needs many test batches before accuracy saturates. The key limitation is therefore slow convergence caused by a static update magnitude that does not reflect how far the current batch is from the optimum.",
    "Methods": "Method name: AdaEnt – Adaptive-Entropy Test-time Adaptation.\nMinimal change to TENT/DELTA-TENT:\n1. Keep exactly the same parameters to adapt (BN weight & bias) and optimiser.\n2. Replace the loss L = E (mean softmax entropy) with\n   L = (E / E_max) * E  =  (E^2 / E_max) ,   where E_max = log(C) is the maximal entropy for C classes.\n   Equivalently, we rescale the gradient by the factor (E / E_max), which is\n      high when predictions are uncertain (large entropy) → big step,\n      low when the model is already confident → tiny step.\nTheoretically this realises a simple form of error-proportional step-size similar to Polyak’s step rule: updates are large when we are far from the optimum and automatically decay as we approach it, accelerating early progress while retaining stability later. No extra hyper-parameters are introduced and the modification is one line of code.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Base method: official TENT implementation.\nDataset: CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C (severity 5→1) using the same pretrained ResNet-18 and evaluation script as in the public TENT repo.\nProtocol:\n1. Stream the test set in its natural order with batch size 128 (online setting).\n2. Measure top-1 accuracy after the first k batches (k = 1, 3, 5, 10) and after the full pass.\n3. Compare TENT vs. AdaEnt and DELTA-TENT vs. AdaEnt+DELTA.\nMetrics:\n• Accuracy-vs-batches curve.\n• \"B90\" – number of batches required to reach 90 % of final accuracy (lower is faster).",
    "Experimental Code": "# --- only the changed lines are shown -----------------------------\nimport torch, torch.nn as nn\n\nE_MAX = math.log(NUM_CLASSES)  # constant\n\ndef forward_and_adapt(x, model, optimizer):\n    outputs = model(x)\n    entropy = softmax_entropy(outputs).mean(0)\n    loss = (entropy / E_MAX) * entropy   # AdaEnt loss\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    return outputs",
    "Expected Result": "Across CIFAR-10-C severe corruptions we expect:\n• Final accuracy nearly identical to TENT (±0.1 %).\n• B90 reduced by ≈30 – 40 % (e.g. from 12 batches to 7).\n• Accuracy after the very first batch ↑ by ~2-3 pp due to the larger initial update. Similar relative gains are expected on CIFAR-100-C and when AdaEnt is combined with DELTA.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single, parameter-free rescaling of the entropy loss turns it into an adaptive step-size mechanism. This makes early updates more aggressive when they matter most and automatically dampens them later, yielding noticeably faster convergence while preserving or slightly improving final accuracy. Because the modification touches only one line of the standard TENT code, it is trivial to integrate into any existing FTTA pipeline."

# Experimental Design
- Strategy: Objective
Develop a single, end-to-end experimental playbook that every subsequent experiment will follow to show that AdaEnt is (1) faster, (2) at least as accurate, (3) computationally cheap, (4) robust across shifts, and (5) generally applicable.

1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
1.1 Speed-of-convergence AdaEnt lowers the number of batches/updates required to reach a target accuracy.
1.2 Final performance AdaEnt matches or exceeds the final accuracy of existing FTTA methods.
1.3 Computational efficiency The extra arithmetic is negligible; runtime and memory footprint remain unchanged (±1 %).
1.4 Robustness & stability Updates do not diverge; variance across seeds is not worse; clean-data performance is not harmed.
1.5 Generalisation Benefits persist across datasets, corruption severities, model architectures and complementary FTTA extensions (e.g. DELTA-TENT).

2. Experimental Axes (applied everywhere)
2.1 Quantitative speed metrics
     • Accuracy-vs-batches curve
     • B90 / B95 (batches to 90 %/95 % of final acc.)
     • Entropy decay curve (diagnostic)
2.2 Quantitative accuracy metrics
     • Final top-1 accuracy (full stream)
     • Area under accuracy-vs-batches curve (AUC) for holistic view
     • ECE / calibration error (secondary)
2.3 Computational cost
     • Wall-clock time per batch (forward+backward) on A100
     • Peak GPU memory (nvidia-smi)
2.4 Robustness probes
     • Variance across 3 independent seeds
     • Clean-data drop (∆acc on uncorrupted test set)
     • Catastrophic-drift rate (percentage of runs whose acc.<acc. of frozen model)
2.5 Qualitative analysis
     • Distribution of adaptive step sizes over time
     • t-SNE of BN-statistics trajectory (optional)

3. Required Comparisons (every experiment includes all that apply)
3.1 Baselines
     • Frozen model (no adaptation)
     • TENT
     • DELTA-TENT (if DELTA is in scope)
3.2 Ablations
     • AdaEnt with fixed scalar α (checks that adaptivity, not rescaling constant, drives gains)
     • AdaEnt on logits vs on probabilities (gradient flow sanity)
3.3 State-of-the-art (dataset permitting): SHOT-IM, MEMO, SAR, etc.
3.4 Oracle (upper bound): full-batch TENT with tuned huge LR (offline) to show speed, not LR, causes gains.

4. Dataset & Model Matrix
Tier-1 (low compute): CIFAR-10-C / 100-C, ResNet-18
Tier-2 (mid): ImageNet-C, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16
Tier-3 (stress): Real-world shifts (Wilds, ImageNet-R) & synthetic heavy corruptions severity 5→1 streams
The same protocol (online streaming, batch = 128, natural order) is reused everywhere.

5. Validation Criteria (pass/fail)
A. Speed: B90 reduced by ≥25 % with p<0.05 (paired t-test across seeds)
B. Final accuracy: ∆acc ≥ –0.2 pp relative to best baseline (i.e., not worse)
C. Cost: Runtime overhead ≤1 %, memory overhead ≤50 MB
D. Robustness: std(acc) not higher than baseline; clean-data drop ≤0.2 pp
Meeting A+B+C on Tier-1 plus any two of A/B improvements on Tier-2 signals success. Failing any criterion triggers deeper ablation or hyper-check.

6. Statistical Protocol
• 3 seeds per setting; report mean±std
• Use paired t-test (speed, accuracy) with Holm correction across datasets
• Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for B90 and ∆acc

7. Reporting Template (all future papers/notes)
Figure 1: Accuracy-vs-batches (all methods)
Table 1: Final acc., B90, B95, AUC, runtime, memory
Table 2: Clean-data drop, std, catastrophic-drift rate
Figure 2: Histogram of adaptive LR factors per batch

8. Computational Logistics
• One 80 GB A100 easily fits batch = 128 for all models; run seeds in parallel via CUDA MPS or sequentially for fairness.
• Always log GPU util and wall-clock with nvprof wrapper.
• Checkpoint BN params every 50 batches for post-hoc trajectory plots (≈1 MB/run).

This strategy supplies a uniform, multi-angle validation framework. Each forthcoming experiment plugs into this template—only the concrete dataset, model and corruption list change—ensuring comparability, statistical rigour and comprehensive evidence for AdaEnt’s effectiveness.
